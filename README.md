# Small World Engine

<img align="right" width="280" alt="Small World Engine" src="public/assets/logo_vector.svg" />

**Small World Engine** is the "Preact of 3D Engines". It is an ultra-lightweight, high-performance, and strict TypeScript 3D game engine for the web. Built for the era of WebGPU and Playable Ads, it provides a modern Physically Based Rendering (PBR) pipeline and a robust Behavior System—delivering the architectural elegance of a real game engine at a fraction of the bundle size of traditional frameworks.

## 🚀 Features

- **Hybrid PBR Rendering:** High-performance rendering pipeline supporting **WebGPU**, **WebGL 2**, and **WebGL 1** with industry-standard physically based shading (Cook-Torrance BRDF).
- **Linear Lighting Workflow:** All lighting calculations are performed in linear space with automatic sRGB gamma correction for realistic color falloffs and high visual fidelity.
- **Advanced Materials:** Includes standard PBR (Metallic/Roughness), but also physical **Glass/Dielectric** materials with real-time **Screen-Space Refraction**, Index of Refraction (IOR), and Beer's Law for volumetric light absorption.
- **Advanced Camera System:** Unified camera setup where controllers (e.g., `OrbitController`, `FirstPersonController`, `ZoomController`) are standard `Behavior` components attached via `camera.addBehavior()`. Features procedural effects like camera shake and flash.
- **High-Performance Architecture:** Optimized for memory efficiency through **Object Pooling** (`MathPool`), BindGroup & Pipeline Caching (WebGPU), and zero-allocation hot paths to eliminate Garbage Collection pressure.
- **Lighting & Shadows:** Supports Ambient, Directional, Point, Spot, and Area lights. Features robust **Shadow Mapping** (WebGL 2 & WebGPU) with Cascaded Shadow Maps, Hardware Shadow Sampling, and Percentage-Closer (Soft) Filtering (PCSS) for buttery-smooth soft shadows.
- **Clustered Forward+ Lighting:** The camera frustum is divided into a 3D grid of light-culling cells (WebGPU: compute-shader culled; WebGL 2: CPU-culled) so each pixel only evaluates the lights that actually reach it, raising the practical point/spot light budget well past a small fixed cap.
- **Planar & Conformal Reflections:** Real-time planar floor reflections (virtual mirror geometries) and dynamic sphere inversion reflections ($P' = C + V \cdot \frac{R^2}{d^2 - r^2}$) for PBR objects.
- **Component Behaviors & State Machines:** Robust, callback-driven behavior system to attach complex logic (`FlickerBehavior`, `DeviceOrientationController`, `HoverBehavior`, `DraggableBehavior`, etc.) directly to 3D objects, cameras, or materials. Includes a built-in, type-safe, zero-allocation **Finite State Machine (FSM)** framework to cleanly manage game actor lifecycles.
- **Interactions & Gamification:** A built-in `InteractionManager` allowing objects to instantly react to mouse/touch pointer events (`onPointerEnter`, `onPointerClick`, `onPointerDown`, `onPointerMove`, etc.). Pickable elements are queried via highly performant $O(\log n)$ **Octrees** and resolved to exact pixels via the **Möller-Trumbore** intersection algorithm. 
- **Stylized & Cinematic Post-Processing:** ACES Filmic, Reinhard, and Cineon Tone Mapping with parametric Color Grading (lift/gamma/gain, color temperature), plus Bloom, Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion (HBAO), Temporal Anti-Aliasing (TAA with camera jitter + history blend), Motion Trails, and retro/stylized shaders (Phosphor Night Vision, Film Noir, Cyber Glitch, VHS Tracking, Thermal Vision).
- **Scene Graph:** Hierarchical scene management using a clean `Object3D` architecture.
- **2D/2.5D Support:** First-class support for Sprites, Billboard rendering, and Pixel-Perfect Isometric perspectives.
- **Audio System:** Built-in `AudioSystem` with 3D Spatial Audio (HRTF), a procedural Retro Synthesizer (footsteps, lasers, drones, fire), and a built-in Mixer with procedural Reverb.
- **Decoupled Architecture:** Features a high-performance, strictly-typed global `EventBus` injected into all systems (`this.events`), separating Gameloop, Behaviors, and UI without relying on garbage-heavy DOM `CustomEvent` objects.
- **Declarative Level & Kit Pipeline (ADR 0020):** JSON-Schema-validated level descriptors (`level.schema.json`) and modular `KitRegistry` with procedural kit fallback, socket light mounting, and metadata binding.
- **Basis Universal / KTX2 Texture Transcoding:** Native WASM-based transcoding for `KHR_texture_basisu` with automatic runtime negotiation for hardware GPU formats (BC7, ASTC, ETC2, BC3).
- **Procedural Generation & Authoring Tooling:** Includes procedural generation utilities like the `GridLevelBuilder` to generate complete dungeon levels from ASCII maps, plus a comprehensive tool suite (`MakerApp`, `MapGenerator`, `Pixler`, `Xtractor`, `Forge`, `MaterialStudio`).
- **Geometry & Asset Loaders:** Dynamic terrain generation, comprehensive primitive library, and async loaders for glTF 2.0 (with extensions), OBJ models, MTLLib materials, and textures (via unified static factories like `Texture.fromUrl()`).
- **Hardware Telemetry & Feature Detection:** Built-in `DeviceCaps` provides robust detection of WebGPU/WebGL API support, hardware limits (Memory, Cores, Texture Sizes), and experimental browser features (Wasm, Async, Generic Sensors).
- **SPA & Frontend Framework Ready:** Fully compatible with React, Vue, and Angular. Features a robust `engine.destroy()` lifecycle hook that completely frees GPU memory and detaches global event listeners. The engine even auto-destroys if it detects its canvas has been unmounted from the DOM.

### ⚡ Under the Hood (Hardcore Engineering)

- **Zero-Allocation Render Loop:** The critical path is strictly structured to ensure **zero memory allocations** (garbage) during the main render loop. This eliminates unpredictable Garbage Collection (GC) pauses, guaranteeing consistently smooth framerates.
- **Custom Math Engine from Scratch:** We don't rely on massive external math libraries like `glMatrix`. Small World features a bespoke, highly-optimized mathematics library for vectors and matrices, tailored exactly for our right-handed coordinate system.
- **Advanced Rendering & Post-Processing:** Consistent linear space math through the entire pipeline, featuring a highly efficient, unified final pass for Tone-Mapping, Color-Grading, Vignette, and sRGB Gamma Correction.
- **Advanced Materials & Fluid Surfaces (ADR 0013):** Built-in PBR, Retro Screen, and unified liquid shaders (Wave family: `OpenWaterMaterial`/`StylizedWaterMaterial` with Gerstner waves and depth-fade; Flow family: `LavaMaterial`/`SlimeMaterial` with noise flow and emissive glow).
- **WebGPU Compute Shaders:** Real compute-shader usage, not just the graphics pipeline — e.g. the Clustered Forward+ Lighting pass culls every light against the frustum grid on the GPU before the main render pass runs.
- **Automated GPU Memory Management:** No more manual `geometry.dispose()` or `material.dispose()`. The engine utilizes rigorous internal reference counting across all renderers. When you remove an object from the scene, orphaned WebGL/WebGPU resources are safely and automatically garbage-collected.
- **Absolute "Zero Dependency" Philosophy:** No Three.js, no Babylon.js. We built a complete 3D engine—including Frustum Culling (`frustum.intersectsVolume(obj.bounds)`), Scene Graph, and Resource Management—entirely from scratch. This keeps the footprint tiny and performance at the absolute maximum.

## 📦 Installation

This package is private and not published to the NPM registry yet. Clone the repository and install
dependencies locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rottensteiner-stefan/small-world.git
cd small-world
npm install
```

## 🎮 Quick Start

The engine provides a `SmallWorld` base class that handles the render loop and hardware initialization automatically.

### 1. Configuration

You can configure the engine by passing an options object to the constructor. In modern bundlers (like Vite), you can also import a JSON file directly.

```typescript
import config from "./config/small-world.json";

class MyGame extends SmallWorld {
  constructor() {
    // Pass the configuration to the engine
    super(config);
  }
// ...
```

### 2. Implementation Showcase

```typescript
import { SmallWorld, Cube, Color, StandardMaterial, Object3D, OrbitController, Texture } from "small-world";

class MyGame extends SmallWorld {
  constructor() {
    super(); // Or pass config here
  }
  protected async setupScene(): Promise<void> {
    // 1. Load a texture and create a PBR material
    const albedoTex = await Texture.fromUrl("./assets/textures/diffuse.png");
    const geometry = new Cube({ size: 2 }).getGeometryData();
    const material = new StandardMaterial({
      map: albedoTex,
      color: Color.DODGERBLUE,
      metallic: 0.7,
      roughness: 0.2,
    });

    // 2. Wrap in an Object3D and add to scene
    const cube = new Object3D("MyCube");
    cube.geometry = geometry;
    cube.material = material;
    cube.position.set(0, 1, 0);

    this.scene.add(cube);

    // 3. Configure the camera and attach behaviors (controllers)
    this.camera.position.set(5, 5, 5);
    this.camera.target.set(0, 0, 0);

    // Camera controllers are now behaviors!
    this.camera.addBehavior(new OrbitController());
    this.camera.addBehavior(new ZoomController());
  }

  protected override update(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Logic executed every frame
  }
}

// Start the application
const game = new MyGame();
game.start();
```
