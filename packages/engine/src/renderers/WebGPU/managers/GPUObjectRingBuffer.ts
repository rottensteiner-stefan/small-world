 * per-frame slot dedup (same object+material reused across multiple draws, e.g. a shadow caster
 * drawn across 4 CSM cascades, gets one slot instead of a fresh one each time) and the
 * grows-only capacity management that avoids resizing mid-encode.
 *
 * Extracted from `WebGPURenderer` -- see .agents/collaborate/god-objects-refactoring.md Phase 4.
 * No behavior change. Deliberately does NOT know how to pack a `RenderManifest`/`Object3D` into
 * `ObjectUniforms` bytes -- that's `WebGPURenderer._packObjectUniforms()`'s job (real business
 * logic tied to shaders/materials/skinning, not generic ring-buffer bookkeeping). `acquireSlot()`
 * only decides WHICH offset a (possibly deduped) draw gets and whether the caller still needs to
 * pack+`write()` into it.
