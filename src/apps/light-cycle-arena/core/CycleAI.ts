/**
 * One-step lookahead chase heuristic: at each grid intersection, scores the 3 reachable
 * directions (straight/left/right -- reversing into your own trail isn't a reachable option
 * on this grid in the first place) by whether they're immediately safe and how much they close
 * the Manhattan distance to `target`.
 *
 * Deliberately not a `StateMachineBehavior`: there's exactly one decision made once per
 * intersection, not an ongoing per-frame state -- a full FSM here would be abstraction without
 * a second state to justify it. Revisit if a future pass wants genuinely distinct behavior
 * modes (e.g. a real ambush "cut off the exit" plan instead of pure greedy chase).
