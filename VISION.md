# The Small World Vision

**Small World** is built on a clear conviction: **Atmosphere, art direction, and game feel beat brute-force hardware specs every single time.**

We are the "Preact of 3D Engines" — lean, agile, and architecturally pure. But Small World is neither a toy nor a compromise for tiny tech demos. It is built to power **real, ambitious, deeply atmospheric games and immersive interactive worlds** — in the spirit of indie masterpieces like *Stray*, *Inside*, or *Journey* — without requiring a $2,000 graphics card or a 50GB download.

## 🎨 The Philosophy: Art Direction Over "Spec Chasing"

In modern 3D development, the industry has fallen into an unsustainable trap: chasing 8K photorealism, unoptimized gigabyte textures, and raytracing pipelines that melt expensive GPUs while burning through player batteries and hardware budgets.

We reject that bloat. **Great 3D experiences are made of:**
- **Coherent Art Direction & Lighting Mood:** Warm bounce lights, evocative volumetric fog, cinematic post-processing, and striking silhouettes.
- **Immediate Tactile Game Feel:** Zero-latency input, smooth physics, punchy spatial audio, and robust component-driven behavior state machines.
- **Universal Accessibility:** Running at a locked 60 FPS on everyday laptops, MacBooks, smartphones, and standard web browsers without sounding like a jet engine taking off.
- **Frictionless Creation:** Composing living worlds visually in minutes via **Maker** without installing gigabytes of proprietary desktop software or wrestling with build pipelines.

## The Pain Points We Solve

### 1. The Monolithic Engine Tax vs. High-Performance Indie Gaming
**The Problem:** Enterprise 3D engines are massive behemoths. Even a blank scene pulls megabytes of un-treeshakable runtime overhead, while desktop engines demand multi-gigabyte installs and steep licensing models.
**Our Solution:** Small World delivers a complete game engine architecture (Hybrid WebGPU/WebGL 2 PBR renderer, physics, spatial audio, behavior systems, FSMs) in a razor-thin footprint with zero external dependencies in the rendering core. It scales effortlessly from instant playable experiences up to full-featured, narrative 3D titles.

### 2. Real Game Engine Architecture (Not Just a "Renderer")
**The Problem:** Most lightweight web 3D tools are mere rendering libraries. They leave game loops, actor state, physics, spatial sound, and input handling as an exercise for the developer, forcing teams to duct-tape mismatched libraries together or drag heavy DOM reconciliation frameworks into a 60FPS loop.
**Our Solution:** An integrated **Behavior System** (`addBehavior(new HoverBehavior())`), type-safe **Finite State Machines** (`StateMachine`), built-in **Impulse Physics** (SAT collisions, buoyancy, sub-stepping), 3D **Spatial Audio** (HRTF, synthesizers), and an $O(\log n)$ **Octree Interaction Manager**. Everything you need to build rich gameplay exists out of the box with zero runtime friction.

### 3. Developer Experience (DX) & Strict TypeScript
**The Problem:** Legacy 3D codebases carry a decade of dynamic JavaScript debt, loosely patched types, and silent runtime `any` failures.
**Our Solution:** 100% strict TypeScript. No `any`. Explicit access encapsulation (`_privateField`) and clean getters/setters. Autocomplete that never lies, fail-fast lifecycle assertions, and an API designed for developers who take craftsmanship seriously.

### 4. Hybrid WebGPU & WebGL 2 Without Lock-In
**The Problem:** The transition to WebGPU has fractured many ecosystems into incompatible node graphs and experimental shader dialects.
**Our Solution:** Designed hybrid from day one. Modern WebGPU compute shaders (e.g. Clustered Forward+ Light Culling) deliver maximum efficiency when available, with a rock-solid, zero-cost fallback to WebGL 2. Shaders use static parameter specialization without proprietary visual scripting lock-in.

### 5. Open Standards & The Modular Asset Kit Pipeline
**The Problem:** Proprietary asset silos and closed marketplace formats lock creators in, while monolithic asset repos cause agonizing clone times.
**Our Solution:** Universal open standards (`.glb`, glTF 2.0 PBR, semantic JSON manifests). Creators can import, snap, and assemble models from the global CC0/CC-BY ecosystem (Kenney, Poly Haven, Sketchfab, Blender) or AI generation tools (Tripo3D, Meshy) in seconds.

### 6. Visual Scene Authoring via Maker
**The Problem:** Authoring 3D scenes purely in code is tedious, while traditional desktop editors isolate developers behind heavy installers and separate build steps.
**Our Solution:** **Maker** (`public/tools/maker.html`) — a dedicated, zero-install, in-browser 3D world editor. Powered by the native File System Access API, Maker offers camera-cardinal keyboard transformation, dynamic grid stepping, marquee selection, isolated 3D prefab rendering, and continuous glTF 2.0 autosave with non-destructive `SW_*` extensions. You design visually, save directly to your repository, and run immediately in engine.

## ⚡ Our Core Tenets

1. **Atmosphere > Pixel Counting:** Rich lighting, thoughtful color palettes, stylized post-processing, and strong silhouettes create timeless games. We don't need 8K brute force to evoke genuine emotion.
2. **Lean Power:** Zero-allocation hot paths, object pooling, and custom right-handed math engines ensure buttery smooth performance on normal consumer hardware.
3. **DX is King:** Standalone authoring tools (**Maker**, **The Forge**, **PBR/IBL/Map/Sprite Generators**) ship directly with the engine to let developers focus on creating games rather than configuring tooling.
4. **Open & Portable:** Standard glTF 2.0, standard web APIs, zero cloud lock-in.
5. **No Compromises on Architecture:** Strict typing, decoupled event systems, robust lifecycles, and predictable memory management.

Small World is the engine for developers and digital artists who want to craft captivating, atmospheric, and truly memorable 3D games for the open web.
