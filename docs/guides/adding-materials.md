# Adding a New Material

This guide is aimed at engine contributors: it explains how to add a new material to Small World, not how to use the built-in ones (see [Materials & Shaders](/guides/materials) for that).

## Two Ways to Add a Material

**`CustomShaderMaterial`** - write raw shader source and hand it to a single, ready-made material class. No new TypeScript class, no engine changes. Good for one-off effects, Shadertoy/ComputeToys imports, or prototyping.

**A new `AbstractMaterial` subclass** - write a proper TypeScript class with typed constructor options and public properties (`material.roughness = 0.4`, etc.), backed by its own shader. Good for anything that should be reused project-wide, documented, and exported from the engine.

The rest of this guide covers the second path - it's also what `CustomShaderMaterial` does internally, just without a dedicated class wrapping it.

## The Two Methods Every Material Implements

`AbstractMaterial` (`packages/engine/src/core/materials/AbstractMaterial.ts`) requires exactly two methods:

```typescript
public abstract getRenderManifest(): RenderManifest;
public abstract getShaderDefinition(): ShaderDefinition;
```

`getShaderDefinition()` is called once per shader variant and describes the shader itself: its source code for each renderer dialect, and its `layout` (which uniforms and textures it expects). `getRenderManifest()` is called every frame and returns the *current values* for those uniforms/textures - the renderer reads only this manifest; it never inspects your material's fields directly.

A minimal real example, abridged from `PhongMaterial.ts`:

```typescript
public override getShaderDefinition(): ShaderDefinition {
  return {
    id: this.type, // a unique string ID, e.g. MaterialType.PHONG or a custom string
    sources: {
      glsl300: { vs: "[BASE_VERTEX_HEADER][BASE_VERTEX_MAIN]", fs: fragGLSL },
      glsl100: { vs: "[BASE_VS]", fs: fragGLSL100 },
      wgsl: `[WGSL_STRUCTS]\n[WGSL_PBR_MATH]\n[WGSL_VS]\n${fragWGSL}`,
    },
    layout: {
      ...StandardWebGPULayout,
      textures: {
        u_diffuseMap: { type: ShaderPropertyType.TEXTURE },
        u_normalMap: { type: ShaderPropertyType.TEXTURE },
        u_specularMap: { type: ShaderPropertyType.TEXTURE },
      },
    },
  };
}

public override getRenderManifest(): RenderManifest {
  if (undefined === this._renderManifest) this._renderManifest = this._createBaseManifest();
  this._syncBaseManifestState();

  const props = this._renderManifest.properties as Record<string, unknown>;
  const texs = this._renderManifest.textures as Record<string, unknown>;
  props["u_color"] = this.color.toFloat32Array();
  props["u_shininess"] = this.shininess;
  texs["u_diffuseMap"] = this.diffuseMap;
  return this._renderManifest;
}
```

`AbstractMaterial._createBaseManifest()`/`_syncBaseManifestState()` already pre-fill the properties every material shares (color, culling, blending, fog parameters, ...) - call them first and override only what your material actually adds.

The tokens `[BASE_VERTEX_HEADER]`, `[WGSL_PBR_MATH]`, etc. are shared shader building blocks, registered in `CoreShaderChunks.ts` and expanded by `ShaderRegistry.instance.assemble()`. Reuse them instead of re-deriving lighting/fog/PBR math by hand.

## The Three Shader Dialects

A material can supply up to three independent shader sources: `wgsl` (WebGPU), `glsl300` (WebGL2), `glsl100` (WebGL1). Each renderer compiles only its own dialect - there is no auto-transpiler between them. A material only needs to support the renderers relevant to it; if `glsl100` is omitted, that material simply throws an error when the app runs under `WebGL1Renderer` (this is intentional, e.g. for pure WGSL Shadertoy imports - see `CustomShaderMaterial`).

Since the three sources are maintained by hand and independently, they *will* drift apart - a uniform present in the WGSL version but missing (or misspelled) in the GLSL300 version is a common source of bugs, and it doesn't show up as a compile error, only as a texture/uniform silently never being set. After changing or adding a material's shaders, run:

```bash
npm run build:showcases && npm run preview
node .agents/scratches/sweep-renderer.mjs WEB_GL1
node .agents/scratches/sweep-renderer.mjs WEB_GL2
```

against a showcase that uses the material, for both renderer dialects. It loads each showcase headlessly and reports real GL compile/link/`GL_INVALID_OPERATION` errors - the project's own `npm run test:showcases` (`scripts/check-showcases.js`) now also forces all three renderer types (`WEB_GL1`/`WEB_GL2`/`WEB_GPU`) via Swiftshader flags and captures per-renderer console errors, so it's a valid alternative for WebGL1/WebGL2 shader bugs; for WebGPU, headless Chrome remains unreliable (see the `showcases-smoke-test` CI job, intentionally non-blocking).

## Uniform and Texture Binding Is Automatic

The WebGL1/WebGL2 renderers determine a compiled shader's uniforms and sampler texture units by querying the linked GPU program directly (`gl.getActiveUniform`), instead of consulting a hand-maintained list of expected names. This means: **as soon as a uniform or texture is declared in the shader source and listed in `layout.uniforms`/`layout.textures`, it "just works"** - nothing in `WebGL1Renderer.ts`/`WebGL2Renderer.ts` needs to be touched to support it, and there is no internal name list whose update could be forgotten.

The one thing that still has to match by convention: the property/texture keys written in `getRenderManifest()` (e.g. `texs["u_diffuseMap"]`) must be spelled exactly like the corresponding `uniform sampler2D u_diffuseMap;` in the shader source. A mismatch is not a compile error - the uniform simply never gets written, so the sampler is left at whatever the GPU driver defaults to.

If a name in `layout.uniforms`/`layout.textures` has no matching active uniform in the compiled shader (a typo, or the shader compiler optimized it away because it's actually unused), `WebGL1Renderer` logs a console warning naming the mismatch - a quick way to spot a typo without having to search through the render output.

Cube vs. 2D textures are also detected automatically, based on the sampler type declared in the shader (`samplerCube` vs. `sampler2D`), not on the uniform's name - so a new cube-sampler uniform likewise needs no name-based special case.

Shadow-map and IBL samplers (irradiance/prefilter/BRDF) are the one exception: they are scene-global rather than per-material, and are bound via dedicated code paths in `WebGL2Renderer` with fixed texture units, regardless of what a new material declares. Nothing needs to be done for this - it's only relevant if the shadow/IBL system itself is changed.
