# Sources & References

This document serves to record external sources, algorithms, mathematical derivations, and inspirations that flowed into the development of **small-world**.

## Geometry & Mathematics

### `Gear`

- **File:** `packages/engine/src/geometry/Gear.ts`
- **Source:** [Rechneronline - Zahnrad berechnen](https://rechneronline.de/pi/zahnrad.php)
- **Usage:** The underlying formulas for generating isometric trapezoidal teeth, pitch circles, and radii for the 3D gear were taken from this tool and adapted.

### Matrix and Quaternion Derivations (General Reference)

- **File:** Mainly affects `packages/engine/src/math/Matrix4.ts`, `packages/engine/src/math/Quaternion.ts`, `packages/engine/src/math/Matrix3.ts` as well as cameras/projections.
- **Source:** [Mathematische Grundlagen der 3D-Grafik (David Nadlinger, 2008/2009)](https://klickverbot.at/science/3d-mathematics/3d-mathematics.pdf)
- **Usage:** An excellent and compact German summary of the underlying 3D mathematics. Contains derivations for rotations (avoiding gimbal lock via quaternions), view matrix, and projection matrix (incl. frustum and clipping). Serves as a general reference for the engine's math, since `small-world` uses the OpenGL convention (right-handed system, column vectors) as described there.

### Introduction to 3D Graphics and Rendering Pipeline (David Scherfgen)

- **File:** Affects the general architecture of the engine (e.g., lighting, shaders, geometry buffers, cameras).
- **Source:** [Einführung in die 3D-Grafik (David Scherfgen)](https://www.david-scherfgen.de/downloads/neues-buch-kapitel-3d-grafik.pdf)
- **Usage:** This book chapter provides a phenomenal overview of the entire rendering pipeline (from vector to pixel on the screen). It details topics such as the Phong lighting model (Ambient, Diffuse, Specular), shading types (Flat, Gouraud, Phong), texturing (MIP-mapping, Anti-Aliasing), and the Z-Buffer. **Note:** In contrast to `small-world` (OpenGL convention), this script primarily uses the Direct3D convention (left-handed coordinate system, row vectors).

### Fast, Minimum Storage Ray/Triangle Intersection (Möller-Trumbore)

- **File:** `packages/engine/src/physix/Raycaster.ts`
- **Authors/Gurus:** Tomas Möller and Ben Trumbore (1997)
- **Source:** [Fast, Minimum Storage Ray-Triangle Intersection](https://cadxfem.org/inf/Fast%20MinimumStorage%20RayTriangle%20Intersection.pdf)
- **Usage:** This is the mathematical gold standard for ray-triangle intersection testing without requiring precomputed plane equations. Used in the `Raycaster` to provide mathematically exact, pixel-perfect polygon picking of 3D objects, directly against their `GeometryDataInterface` vertices after accelerating the queries with `Octree` AABB bounding box checks.

### Octree Spatial Partitioning

- **File:** `packages/engine/src/core/Octree.ts`
- **Authors/Gurus:** Donald Meagher (1980)
- **Source:** [Octree Encoding: A New Solid Representation for Computer Graphics](https://rpi.edu/)
- **Usage:** Used as the fundamental spatial acceleration structure for the engine. It recursively divides 3D space into eight octants, allowing collision detection, frustum culling, and raycasting (picking) to operate in $O(\log n)$ time instead of $O(n)$, drastically improving performance in scenes with many objects.

### `AxesHelper` (3D Cartesian Coordinate System Visualization)

- **File:** `packages/engine/src/core/helpers/AxesHelper.ts`
- **Source:** Standard Computer Graphics RGB Coordinate Convention ($+X$ = Red, $+Y$ = Green, $+Z$ = Blue) and OpenGL Right-Handed System.
- **Usage:** Visualizes local and world coordinate systems using neon unlit cylinder shafts, cone arrowheads, and camera-facing billboarded text labels (`Sprite` + `TextTexture`). Integrated into `GadgetInspector` to visually track scene origin and animated bone transforms in real time.

### Gielis Superformula (Supershapes)

- **File:** `packages/geometry-extras/src/Supershape.ts`
- **Authors/Gurus:** Johan Gielis (2003), generalizing Gabriel Lamé's superellipse (1818)
- **Source:** [Gielis: "A generic geometric transformation that unifies a wide range of natural and abstract shapes" (American Journal of Botany, 2003)](https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3732/ajb.90.3.333)
- **Formulas:**
  - $r(\theta) = \left( \left|\frac{\cos(m\theta/4)}{a}\right|^{n_2} + \left|\frac{\sin(m\theta/4)}{b}\right|^{n_3} \right)^{-1/n_1}$
  - 3D supershape surface combines two independent profiles $r_1(\theta)$ (longitude) and $r_2(\phi)$ (latitude): $x = r_1 \cos\theta \cdot r_2 \cos\phi$, $y = r_2 \sin\phi$, $z = r_1 \sin\theta \cdot r_2 \cos\phi$.
- **Usage:** Drives the exotic `Supershape` geometry in the `@small-world/geometry-extras` package. A single closed-form formula, parametrized by two independent superformula profiles, produces a huge family of closed surfaces (spheres, starfish, gemstones, organic blobs) without any bespoke per-shape code.

### (p,q) Torus Knot Parametrization

- **File:** `packages/geometry-extras/src/TorusKnot.ts`
- **Source:** Standard parametric torus knot curve, $x(u) = R(2+\cos(\frac{q}{p}u))\frac{\cos u}{2}$, $y(u) = R\sin(\frac{q}{p}u)\frac{1}{2}$, $z(u) = R(2+\cos(\frac{q}{p}u))\frac{\sin u}{2}$ for $u \in [0, 2\pi p]$; well known from knot theory and widely used as a graphics primitive (e.g. three.js `TorusKnotGeometry`).
- **Usage:** `TorusKnot.generateGeometryData()` sweeps a circular tube cross-section along this curve. The per-vertex normal/binormal frame is built by projecting a fixed reference "up" vector against the curve tangent (Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization), swapping to a secondary reference near the singular case where the tangent is (almost) parallel to it — a cheaper, seam-free alternative to a full parallel-transport Frenet frame for a closed periodic curve.

### Möbius Strip Parametrization

- **File:** `packages/geometry-extras/src/MobiusStrip.ts`
- **Source:** Standard Möbius strip surface parametrization, $x(u,v) = (R + v\cos(u/2))\cos(u)$, $y(u,v) = v\sin(u/2)$, $z(u,v) = (R + v\cos(u/2))\sin(u)$ for $u \in [0, 2\pi]$, $v \in [-w/2, w/2]$ — the canonical single-half-twist non-orientable surface (August Möbius & Johann Listing, 1858).
- **Usage:** `MobiusStrip` renders the surface as an open strip mesh (first and last ring are never explicitly welded together) instead of a closed loop, since the two boundary rings only coincide in space after an implicit $v \to -v$ flip. This keeps the discrete mesh orientable and consistently shadeable (`computeNormals()` works unmodified), rather than needing double-sided rendering to fake a globally consistent normal field that a true non-orientable surface cannot have. A `twists` option generalizes the exponent to $n \cdot u/2$, allowing higher odd (Möbius-like) or even (simple twisted band) variants.

### 3D Voronoi Diagram via Half-Space Intersection

- **File:** `packages/geometry-extras/src/VoronoiCells.ts`
- **Authors/Gurus:** Georgy Voronoy (1908); polygon clipping technique after Ivan Sutherland & Gary Hodgman (1974)
- **Source:** Standard computational-geometry construction: a Voronoi cell for seed $S$ is the intersection of half-spaces $\{v : \|v - S\| \le \|v - O\|\}$ over every other seed $O$, each half-space bounded by the perpendicular bisector plane of $S$ and $O$.
- **Usage:** `VoronoiCells` builds each seed's cell by starting from a bounding box and iteratively clipping it against every other seed's bisector plane, using a 3D extension of Sutherland-Hodgman polygon clipping: each clipped face contributes exactly one new edge lying on the cutting plane, and these edges are chained into a new "cap" face closing the cut. A `cellPadding` option shrinks each finished cell towards its own centroid, opening visible gaps between cells for a "shattered crystal" look instead of a seamless tessellation. Candidates are clipped nearest-seed-first with an early skip once a plane is provably further away than the cell's current furthest vertex (`maxDistanceFromPoint` in the same file), avoiding the dominant per-clip cost for neighbors that can no longer affect the cell -- a pragmatic substitute for a full spatial index (k-d-tree/grid) at the point counts this package targets (tens to a few hundred).

### Power Diagram / Additively Weighted (Laguerre-)Voronoi Diagram

- **File:** `packages/geometry-extras/src/VoronoiCells.ts` (`computeCellFaces`)
- **Authors/Gurus:** Edmond Laguerre (1880s); Voronoi/power-diagram formalization is standard in computational geometry literature (e.g. Aurenhammer 1987)
- **Source:** Standard power-distance construction: the bisector between weighted seeds $(S, r_S)$ and $(O, r_O)$ is the plane where $\|v-S\|^2 - r_S^2 = \|v-O\|^2 - r_O^2$, which reduces to the ordinary bisector plane shifted along $\widehat{O-S}$ by $\frac{r_S^2 - r_O^2}{2\|O-S\|}$.
- **Usage:** `VoronoiCellsOptions.weights` lets a seed claim more or less space than a plain Voronoi diagram would give it, by shifting each bisector plane's `planePoint` by this derived offset instead of using the exact midpoint. Reduces to plain Voronoi when all weights are equal. The classical basis for foam/bubble-like structures (unequal cell sizes) instead of the roughly-equal cells a plain Voronoi diagram produces.

### Lloyd Relaxation (Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation)

- **File:** `packages/geometry-extras/src/VoronoiCells.ts` (`relaxPoints`)
- **Authors/Gurus:** Stuart P. Lloyd (1957/1982)
- **Source:** [Lloyd: "Least Squares Quantization in PCM" (IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 1982; written 1957)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1056489)
- **Usage:** `relaxPoints()` (and `VoronoiCellsOptions.relaxationIterations`) repeatedly moves each seed point to its own cell's centroid for a few rounds, converging towards a centroidal Voronoi tessellation. Evens out cell sizes that would otherwise come from pure random point placement (small slivers next to oversized cells), without changing the underlying cell-construction algorithm.

### Fast Poisson Disk Sampling in Arbitrary Dimensions

- **File:** `packages/geometry-extras/src/PoissonDiskSample.ts`
- **Authors/Gurus:** Robert Bridson (2007)
- **Source:** [Bridson: "Fast Poisson Disk Sampling in Arbitrary Dimensions" (SIGGRAPH 2007 Sketches)](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/bridson-siggraph07-poissondisk.pdf)
- **Usage:** `poissonDiskSample()` generates seed points with a guaranteed minimum pairwise distance (via a grid-accelerated dart-throwing process around each newly placed point), instead of the clustering that plain uniform-random point placement produces. Intended as an alternative `VoronoiCellsOptions.points` source for a more evenly spaced "crystal shatter" look.

### Marching Tetrahedra (Scalar Field Isosurface Extraction)

- **File:** `packages/geometry-extras/src/MarchingCubes.ts`
- **Authors/Gurus:** William E. Lorensen & Harvey E. Cline (1987), originators of the Marching Cubes family
- **Source:** [Lorensen & Cline: "Marching Cubes: A High Resolution 3D Surface Construction Algorithm" (SIGGRAPH 1987)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/37401.37422)
- **Usage:** `MarchingCubes` polygonises an arbitrary 3D scalar field (e.g. the bundled `metaballField()` helper) by splitting each grid cube into 6 tetrahedra (standard decomposition along the main diagonal) instead of using the classic algorithm's 256-case cube edge/triangle lookup tables. Each tetrahedron only has 16 simple inside/outside corner combinations (0, 1, or 2 output triangles), which is both immune to the classic algorithm's ambiguous-face hole artifacts and small enough to implement generically (with per-triangle auto-orientation against the local inside-to-outside direction) rather than transcribing the large, error-prone reference table from memory.

### Surface of Revolution (Lathe Geometry)

- **File:** `packages/geometry-extras/src/Lathe.ts`
- **Authors/Gurus:** Standard constructive solid geometry technique; the fixture modelling operation dates back to manual lathe turning.
- **Source:** Parametrization of a rotational surface as $P(u,v) = (r(v)\cos u,\ y(v),\ r(v)\sin u)$; widely available in geometry libraries (e.g. three.js `LatheGeometry`).
- **Usage:** `Lathe` revolves a user-supplied radius×height profile around the Y axis into a vase/bottle/goblet-shaped indexed mesh. A closed ring reuses the first revolution column to avoid a UV seam and back-facing wrap edge; a partial arc keeps distinct boundary columns. The profile must be strictly monotonic in height to avoid self-intersecting rings.

### Platonic Solids via Polar Duality (Dodecahedron Construction)

- **File:** `packages/geometry-extras/src/PlatonicSolid.ts`
- **Authors/Gurus:** Classical geometry (regular convex polyhedra, Euclid's "Elements" Book XIII); polar/dual polyhedron construction.
- **Source:** A regular dodecahedron is the polar dual of a regular icosahedron: each dual vertex is the normalized centroid of an icosahedron face, dual edges join faces sharing an edge, and dual faces are the cyclically ordered stars of the original vertices.
- **Usage:** `PlatonicSolid` generates tetrahedron/octahedron/icosahedron from canonical coordinates and derives the dodecahedron by the verified polar-dual construction above (V=20, E=30, F=12, uniform edge length), avoiding a hand-wired, error-prone pentagon index table. Optional `detail` subdivision normalizes edge midpoints onto the circumscribed sphere to produce geodetic spheres.

### Generic Parametric Surface Grid

- **File:** `packages/geometry-extras/src/ParametricSurface.ts`
- **Authors/Gurus:** Standard parametric surface representation in computer graphics.
- **Source:** $S(u,v) = (x(u,v), y(u,v), z(u,v))$ over a rectangular domain; foundational to any freeform/procedural surface modelling.
- **Usage:** Exposes a single `(u, v) → Vector3D` evaluator over `[uMin,uMax]×[vMin,vMax]`, tessellated into an indexed grid with optional wrap-around in `u`/`v` for periodic (closed) surfaces such as tubes or bands. Covers waves, flags, helixes and terrain patches without a dedicated class per family.

### Ear Clipping with Hole Bridging (Concave Polygon Fill)

- **File:** `packages/geometry-extras/src/FilledPolygon.ts`
- **Authors/Gurus:** David Eberly (Geometric Tools); the robust ear-clipping variant that requires a polygon without holes and the standard bridge insertion to fold holes into a single simple loop.
- **Source:** ["Triangulation by Ear Clipping" (David Eberly, Geometric Tools)](https://www.geometrictools.com/Documentation/TriangulationByEarClipping.pdf)
- **Usage:** `FilledPolygon` ear-clips arbitrary simple concave contours and subtracts holes: each hole is wound opposite to the outer ring, bridged to it through a mutually visible vertex pair, and traced as a closed loop so the doubled connector cut preserves the signed area (`area(outer) − Σ area(holes)`, verified by tests). This generalizes the core `PolygonFan`, which only fills star-shaped profiles.

## Physics & Collision Detection

### Gravitational Lensing (Black Hole Shadow & Einstein Ring)
- **File:** `packages/engine/src/core/materials/shaders/PostProcess.frag.glsl`, `apps/showcases/21/showcase.ts`
- **Inspiration:** Dr. Katie Bouman, Dr. Sara Issaoun, and the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration (2019, 2022)
- **Source:** First imaging of M87* and Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*).
- **Usage:** The visual representation of the Super Massive Black Hole in Showcase 21 is profoundly inspired by the groundbreaking imaging work of the EHT team. The custom post-processing shader approximates the gravitational lensing, deflecting light rays near the simulated event horizon to recreate the iconic asymmetric glowing ring and the absolute black shadow at its core.

### Sequential Impulse & Rigid Body Dynamics

- **Authors/Gurus:** Erin Catto (Creator of Box2D)
- **Usage:** Essential concepts for resolving constraints, joints, and stable resting contacts using sequential impulses, which heavily influence how we stabilize physics loops and design our collision impulse resolution.

### Fixed-Timestep Render Interpolation

- **File:** `packages/engine/src/physix/PhysicsSystem.ts`
- **Authors/Gurus:** Glenn Fiedler (Gaffer On Games)
- **Source:** ["Fix Your Timestep!"](https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/)
- **Usage:** The canonical explanation of why a fixed-timestep physics accumulator needs to hand rendering an interpolated blend (`alpha = accumulator / fixedTimeStep`) between the two most recent physics states, rather than snapping to the latest completed step. Used as the basis for decoupling `small-world`'s variable render framerate from its fixed physics tick, eliminating visual stutter/judder.

### Real-Time Collision Detection

- **Authors/Gurus:** Christer Ericson
- **Usage:** The ultimate reference for implementing the Separating Axis Theorem (SAT), efficient intersection testing, and robust handling of floating-point inaccuracies in spatial math.

### Generic Convex Polyhedron SAT (`ConvexHull` Collider)

- **File:** `packages/engine/src/physix/ConvexHull.ts`, `packages/engine/src/physix/Collision.ts`
- **Authors/Gurus:** Christer Ericson (Real-Time Collision Detection); same underlying theorem as the engine's existing OBB-OBB SAT (`Collision._obbObb`/`resolveObbObb`)
- **Usage:** Generalizes the engine's existing 3+3+9-axis OBB-OBB SAT to an arbitrary convex polyhedron: every face normal of both shapes, plus every pairwise cross product of their edge directions, is a candidate separating axis (`Collision._satPolytopes`). `BoundingBox`/`OBB` are adapted to this same generic test as ad-hoc 8-vertex hulls (`_boxAsHull`/`_obbAsHull`) rather than duplicating the axis logic per shape pair, so `HULL` collides correctly against `SPHERE`/`BOX`/`OBB`/`HULL` alike. Added specifically to give Voronoi fracture shards (`@small-world/physics-extras`'s `fractureObject()`) their own correctly-shaped collider instead of a crude box/sphere approximation.

### Voronoi Fracture (Physics-Based Destruction)

- **File:** `packages/physics-extras/src/VoronoiFracture.ts`
- **Concept:** Common game/VFX destruction technique: partition an object into convex Voronoi cells (see `VoronoiCells` above) and give each cell its own rigid body, so an impact "shatters" the object into physically simulated fragments instead of a scripted animation.
- **Usage:** `fractureObject()` computes each shard as its own clipped cell (reusing `@small-world/geometry-extras`'s `computeCellFaces`/`cellCentroid`), builds a `ConvexHull` collider from it, and gives it a `RigidBody` with an evenly-split share of the original object's mass -- optionally with an initial outward impulse from an `impactPoint`, for a "shatter" kick rather than inert pieces.

### Advanced Collision Detection and Simulation

- **Authors/Gurus:** Ming C. Lin and Nadia Magnenat Thalmann
- **Usage:** Prof. Ming C. Lin is a pioneer in the field of collision detection (I-COLLIDE, SWIFT, V-COLLIDE). Her foundational research in bounding volume hierarchies and fast continuous collision detection provided the theoretical groundwork for modern rigid body physics. Nadia Magnenat Thalmann's pioneering work in simulating virtual humans and deformable objects is a profound inspiration for expanding interactive 3D systems beyond simple rigid bodies.

### Physics-based Character Animation

- **Authors/Gurus:** Jessica Hodgins
- **Usage:** Her foundational research in integrating physical simulations with character animation serves as an ongoing inspiration for adding complex kinematics and physics-driven behaviors to game engines.

## Game Feel & Player Experience

### Trauma-Based Camera Shake

- **File:** `packages/engine/src/core/cameras/effects/ShakeEffect.ts`
- **Authors/Gurus:** Squirrel Eiserloh
- **Source:** ["Math for Game Programmers: Juicing Your Cameras With Math"](https://gdcvault.com/play/1023146/Math-for-Game-Programmers-Juicing) — GDC 2016
- **Usage:** Drives our screen-shake as a decaying "trauma" value with a squared (trauma²) falloff envelope, sampled through continuous simplex noise per axis instead of per-frame white noise — reads as a smooth wobble that eases out, rather than a jittery flicker that cuts off abruptly.

### Hit-Stop / Freeze-Frame

- **File:** `packages/engine/src/core/SmallWorld.ts`
- **Authors/Gurus:** common technique across fighting/action games (e.g. Street Fighter, Bayonetta)
- **Source:** ["Juice It or Lose It"](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1016487/Juice-It-or-Lose) — Martin Jonasson & Petri Purho, GDC Europe 2012
- **Usage:** Briefly scales down gameplay-facing deltaTime (app update, physics step, scene behaviors) on impact while the camera keeps updating at full speed, so its shake/flash effects still play — sells the weight of a hit without pausing the whole engine loop.

- **Usage:** The core specular reflectance model used across both WebGL2 and WebGPU standard PBR pipelines. Composes the microfacet distribution $D$ (Trowbridge-Reitz/GGX for long-tailed specular highlights), geometric shadowing/masking $G$ (Smith model with Schlick-GGX approximation), and Fresnel reflectance $F$ (Schlick approximation) with energy-conserving diffuse split ($k_D = (1 - k_S) \cdot (1 - \text{metallic})$).

- **File:** `apps/showcases/35/showcase.ts`
- **Authors/Gurus:** Khronos Group (glTF Sample Viewer / glTF-Sample-Assets contributors)
- **Source:** [Khronos glTF-Sample-Assets: "MetalRoughSpheres"](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Assets)
- **Usage:** The de-facto industry reference scene for validating a metallic-roughness PBR implementation: a grid of identical spheres with metallic varying along one axis and roughness along the other, under a fixed base color. Showcase 35 reproduces this layout with `StandardMaterial` to visually cross-check PBR shading consistency across the WebGL1/WebGL2/WebGPU renderers via `?rendererType=`.

### Real-Time Rendering Pipeline & State Minimization

- **Authors/Gurus:** Tomas Akenine-Möller, Eric Haines, Naty Hoffman
- **Source:** [Real-Time Rendering (RTR)](https://www.realtimerendering.com/)
- **Usage:** The bible for real-time rendering. Fundamental concepts such as Opaque vs. Transparent rendering order, back-to-front sorting, and state minimization (minimizing draw calls by efficiently grouping by pass -> shader -> material) are derived from here.

### Percentage-Closer Filtering (PCF) for Soft Shadows

- **File:** `packages/engine/src/renderers/WebGL2/WebGL2Renderer.ts`, `packages/engine/src/core/materials/shaders/Phong.frag.glsl`, `packages/engine/src/core/materials/shaders/Standard.frag.glsl`
- **Authors/Gurus:** William T. Reeves, David H. Salesin, and Robert L. Cook (1987)
- **Source:** [Rendering antialiased shadows with depth maps (SIGGRAPH 1987)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/37402.37425)
- **Usage:** The foundational technique for generating soft edges on shadow maps. By sampling the depth map multiple times around the target fragment and averaging the binary visibility results, jagged aliased shadows become smoothly blurred (especially when combined with hardware `sampler2DShadow`).

### Percentage-Closer Soft Shadows (PCSS)

- **File:** `packages/engine/src/core/renderers/shaders/source/web_gl2/chunks/light_calc.frag.glsl`, `packages/engine/src/core/renderers/shaders/source/web_gl2/chunks/light_calc_pbr.frag.glsl`, `packages/engine/src/core/renderers/shaders/source/web_gpu/chunks/pbr_math.wgsl`, `packages/engine/src/core/renderers/shaders/source/web_gpu/chunks/lighting.wgsl`, `packages/engine/src/core/renderers/shaders/source/web_gpu/chunks/lighting_pbr.wgsl`, `packages/engine/src/renderers/WebGL2/WebGL2Renderer.ts`
- **Authors/Gurus:** Randima Fernando (NVIDIA)
- **Source:** ["Percentage-Closer Soft Shadows"](https://download.nvidia.com/developer/presentations/2005/I3D/I3D_05_Percentage_Closer_Soft_Shadows.pdf) — SIGGRAPH 2005
- **Usage:** Upgrades the directional-light PCF pass to a variable-radius filter: a blocker search over a small ring of raw (non-comparison) depth reads estimates how far the average occluder sits below the receiver, which then scales the PCF sample radius so contact shadows stay sharp while shadows further from their caster soften — contact-hardening soft shadows from a single shadow map, no extra light samples or pre-pass needed.

### Image-Space Horizon-Based Ambient Occlusion (HBAO)

- **File:** `packages/engine/src/core/materials/shaders/AO.frag.glsl`, `packages/engine/src/core/materials/shaders/AO.frag.wgsl`, `packages/engine/src/renderers/post/passes/AOPassGL.ts`, `packages/engine/src/renderers/post/passes/AOPassGPU.ts`, `packages/engine/src/renderers/post/elements/HbaoElement.ts`
- **Authors/Gurus:** Louis Bavoil, Miguel Sainz, Rouslan Dimitrov (NVIDIA)
- **Source:** ["Image-Space Horizon-Based Ambient Occlusion"](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/presentations/2008/SIGGRAPH/HBAO_SIG08b.pdf) — SIGGRAPH 2008
- **Usage:** The reference for our screen-space ambient occlusion pass (`HbaoElement` in code) — marching a handful of screen-space directions per pixel and taking `dot(directionToSample, normal)` as the sine of that direction's horizon elevation angle, then darkening by how much of the hemisphere those horizons block. Simplified relative to the paper: a single max-sample per direction instead of true horizon-angle accumulation via the sine-integration formula, and no per-pixel direction rotation or bilateral blur pass to turn banding into noise.

### Normal-Offset Shadow Bias

- **File:** `packages/engine/src/core/renderers/shaders/source/web_gl2/chunks/light_calc.frag.glsl`, `packages/engine/src/core/renderers/shaders/source/web_gl2/chunks/light_calc_pbr.frag.glsl`, `packages/engine/src/core/renderers/shaders/source/web_gl2/chunks/base_vertex_main.vert.glsl`, `packages/engine/src/core/renderers/shaders/source/web_gpu/chunks/lighting.wgsl`, `packages/engine/src/core/renderers/shaders/source/web_gpu/chunks/lighting_pbr.wgsl`
- **Authors/Gurus:** Jasper Flick (Catlike Coding)
- **Source:** [Directional Shadows (Custom SRP) — Catlike Coding](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/custom-srp/directional-shadows/)
- **Usage:** The reference for offsetting the shadow-map sample position along the surface normal (scaled by NdotL) before the light-space transform, instead of only biasing the compared depth value. Separates the fix for shadow acne from depth manipulation, reducing both acne and peter-panning simultaneously across our directional and spot light shadows.

### Temporal Supersampling / TAA (Jitter + History Blend)

- **File:** `packages/engine/src/core/materials/shaders/HistoryBlend.frag.glsl`, `packages/engine/src/core/materials/shaders/HistoryBlend.frag.wgsl`, `packages/engine/src/renderers/post/passes/HistoryBlendPassGL.ts`, `packages/engine/src/renderers/post/passes/HistoryBlendPassGPU.ts`, `packages/engine/src/renderers/post/elements/TaaElement.ts`, `packages/engine/src/core/Camera.ts`, `packages/engine/src/core/SmallWorld.ts`
- **Authors/Gurus:** Brian Karis (Epic Games)
- **Source:** ["High-Quality Temporal Supersampling"](http://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2014/#_HIGH-QUALITY_TEMPORAL_SUPERSAMPLING) — SIGGRAPH 2014, Advances in Real-Time Rendering
- **Usage:** The canonical reference for sub-pixel camera jitter (we use a Halton(2,3) sequence, cycling 16 samples) combined with a history buffer accumulated across frames to reconstruct anti-aliased detail beyond a single frame's sample rate. We implement only the simplified half of the technique — jitter plus an exponential history blend, no motion-vector reprojection or neighborhood clamping — which smooths edges in static/slow scenes but visibly ghosts on fast movement, an accepted trade-off documented in `docs/research/aaa-engine-techniques.md`.

### Accumulation Buffer (Motion Trail / Afterimage Effect)

- **File:** `packages/engine/src/renderers/post/passes/HistoryBlendPassGL.ts`, `packages/engine/src/renderers/post/passes/HistoryBlendPassGPU.ts`, `packages/engine/src/renderers/post/elements/MotionTrailElement.ts`
- **Authors/Gurus:** Paul Haeberli, Kurt Akeley (SGI)
- **Source:** ["The Accumulation Buffer: Hardware Support for High-Quality Rendering"](https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs248-02/haeberli-akeley-accumulation-buffer-sig90.pdf) — SIGGRAPH 1990
- **Usage:** The original paper generalizing "blend this frame with an accumulated buffer of prior frames" beyond anti-aliasing to motion blur, depth-of-field, and soft shadows — the same family of technique as our TAA history blend above, just aimed at a deliberately visible result instead of an invisible one. `MotionTrailElement` reuses the identical `HistoryBlendPassGL`/`HistoryBlendPassGPU` infrastructure as TAA (its own separate instance/history buffer, no camera jitter), tuned with a much higher feedback value so fast-moving objects intentionally leave a ghost/afterimage trail — an honest stylistic effect, not a mislabeled anti-aliasing technique.

### Dual Kawase Bloom (Post-Processing)

- **File:** `packages/engine/src/core/materials/shaders/BloomDownsample.frag.wgsl`, `packages/engine/src/core/materials/shaders/BloomUpsample.frag.wgsl`, `packages/engine/src/renderers/passes/PostProcessPass.ts`
- **Authors/Gurus:** Masaki Kawase (2003) and Marius Bjørge (2014)
- **Source:** [Bandwidth-Efficient Rendering (ARM)](https://community.arm.com/cfs-file/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-20-66/siggraph2015_2D00_mmg_2D00_marius_2D00_notes.pdf)
- **Usage:** Used as the high-performance WebGPU bloom filter. By downsampling using a 13-tap filter and upsampling using a 9-tap tent filter across a mip-chain, this technique produces extremely soft, high-quality glows spanning large screen areas at a fraction of the cost of a traditional Gaussian blur.

### Linear Color Space & Gamma Correctness

- **Authors/Gurus:** Naty Hoffman, Sebastien Lagarde (Frostbite Engine)
- **Source:** SIGGRAPH Presentations & "Moving Frostbite to Physically Based Rendering"
- **Usage:** The law of linear color space: All color textures (albedo) must be converted to linear space (sRGB -> Linear) in the shader before lighting calculations. After all lighting calculations, the result must be converted back to sRGB space (Gamma Correction) before being output to the screen.

### ACES Filmic Tone Mapping (Narkowicz Analytic Fit)

- **File:** `packages/engine/src/core/materials/shaders/PostProcess.frag.glsl`, `packages/engine/src/core/materials/shaders/PostProcess.frag.wgsl`, `packages/engine/src/core/materials/shaders/PostProcess100.frag.glsl`, `packages/engine/src/renderers/post/elements/ToneMappingElement.ts`
- **Authors/Gurus:** Krzysztof Narkowicz (2015), Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS)
- **Source:** [ACES Filmic Tone Mapping Curve (Krzysztof Narkowicz)](https://knarkowicz.wordpress.com/2016/01/06/aces-filmic-tone-mapping-curve/)
- **Formulas:**
  - $f(x) = \text{saturate}\left(\frac{x(a x + b)}{x(c x + d) + e}\right)$ with $a = 2.51$, $b = 0.03$, $c = 2.43$, $d = 0.59$, $e = 0.14$.
- **Usage:** High-performance, closed-form analytic approximation of the ACES S-curve tone mapping operator. Used across all post-processing passes to map high-dynamic-range HDR radiance to standard display ranges with filmic contrast, preserving hue consistency and smoothly compressing highlights without hard white clamping.

### Data-Oriented Design (DOD)

- **Authors/Gurus:** Mike Acton (Insomniac Games, Unity)
- **Usage:** The architectural guideline that data structures (like TypedArrays and flat arrays) should be preferred over OOP and deeply nested objects to avoid CPU cache misses during the rendering loop.

### Component & Behavior Architecture

- **Concepts:** Component-based programming, Unity Behaviors.
- **Usage:** Small World uses a strict behavior-driven architecture where logical components (`Behavior`) are attached directly to nodes like `Object3D` or `Camera` via `.addBehavior()`. This eliminates rigid inheritance structures for controllers (like `OrbitController` or `FPSController`), allowing them to be dynamically composed at runtime.

### Asynchronous Asset Loading

- **Usage:** Provides unified static factories like `Texture.fromUrl()` with promise-based loading. This ensures asynchronous image decoding integrates smoothly into the synchronous render loop, often falling back to a placeholder pixel until the GPU upload is fully complete.

## Graphics APIs (WebGPU / WebGL)

### W3C WebGPU Specification

- **Source:** [WebGPU W3C Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/)
- **Usage:** The absolute single source of truth for WebGPU mechanisms. It establishes the strict validation rules and explicit resource requirements (e.g., why `GPUTextureUsage` must be exactly defined before an operation like `copyTextureToTexture` can be executed).

### WebGPU Fundamentals

- **Authors/Gurus:** Gregg Tavares
- **Source:** [WebGPU Fundamentals](https://webgpufundamentals.org/)
- **Usage:** An excellent source for understanding the conceptual difference between implicit state (WebGL) and explicit pipelines/layouts (WebGPU). Serves as a template for best practices around texture bindings, memory alignments (Uniforms/UBOs), and the safe handling of render passes.

### Tour of WebGPU

- **Authors/Gurus:** Alain Galvan
- **Source:** [Raw WebGPU (Tour of WebGPU)](https://alain.xyz/blog/raw-webgpu)
- **Usage:** Serves as an important architectural reference for understanding bind group layouts, command buffer encoding, and mapping concepts like Vulkan/Metal/D3D12 to the web standard.

## Image Processing & Texture Generation

### Perlin Noise (2D Noise)

- **File:** `public/tools/splatter-gen.html` (as well as engine noise in `packages/engine/src/utils/Noise.ts`)
- **Authors/Gurus:** Ken Perlin (1985 / Improved Noise 2002)
- **Source:** [Making Noise (Ken Perlin)](https://mrl.cs.nyu.edu/~perlin/doc/oscar.html)
- **Usage:** 2D Perlin noise is used to calculate soft, organic disturbances and ripples on circles (Noise Warp). This creates natural-looking splash edges for liquids and mud splatters from simple geometric shapes.

### Liquid Metaballs (Liquid Blobs)

- **File:** `public/tools/splatter-gen.html`
- **Authors/Gurus:** James Blinn (1982)
- **Usage:** The physical concept of metaballs describes organically merging spherical surfaces. In the splatter generator, we draw multiple circles on an offscreen canvas, blur them (density field), and cut them off sharply using a threshold (alpha thresholding). This allows adjacent drops to merge into each other like liquids.

### Box-Blur

- **File:** `public/tools/splatter-gen.html`, `public/tools/pbr-gen.html`
- **Usage:** To simulate Gaussian blur on pixel arrays, a two-stage, linear box-blur (horizontal and vertical pass) is implemented in pure JavaScript. This enables extremely fast real-time image smoothing with O(N) complexity (independent of the radius).

### Normal Map Generation (Sobel Filter)

- **File:** `public/tools/pbr-gen.html`
- **Authors/Gurus:** Irwin Sobel (1968)
- **Source:** Sobel operators for image segmentation / edge detection.
- **Usage:** The normal map is generated by calculating the derivatives of the height map in the X and Y directions using a discrete 3x3 Sobel convolution kernel. The normal vector is calculated from n = normalize(-dx _ s, -dy _ s, 1.0) and encoded into RGB color values in the range [0, 255].

### Sigmoidal Contrast (Specular S-Curves)

- **File:** `public/tools/pbr-gen.html`
- **Source:** ImageMagick `-sigmoidal-contrast` function.
- **Usage:** To raise highlights softly but with high contrast, a sigmoidal curve function f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-c \* (x - t))) is applied to the brightness values. This prevents hard clipping and simulates more realistic specular behavior.

### Laplacian Crevice Cavity Mapping (Ambient Occlusion)

- **File:** `public/tools/pbr-gen.html`
- **Source:** Discrete Laplace filters / edge operators.
- **Usage:** To approximate local self-shadowing (ambient occlusion / crevices), the curvature (second derivative) of the height values is calculated using a Laplace kernel (4 \* center - sum(neighbors)). This highlights depressions and crevices, which are multiplied with a blurred macro height map.

- **Source:** AI-generated (Gemini `gemini-3.1-flash-image`) diffuse photo + skybox faces, roughness/normal maps derived locally via ImageMagick.
- **Usage:** Replaces two assets that were originally reused from unrelated showcases and didn't fit the scene: the street previously used a brass/gear "steampunk" PBR set instead of asphalt, and the skybox was a bright space-nebula texture that blew out through the building gap. The new skybox is a 6-panel horizontal-cross cubemap, each face generated independently and composited (not a single generated cross image, which generative models can't lay out reliably).

- **Usage:** Reference for the stylized (Sea of Thieves-inspired) open-water look: simple sine/noise-based Gerstner-like vertex wave displacement combined with fragment-side depth fade (mixing toward an underwater fog color with scene depth) and screen-space foam near intersections with other geometry, instead of a physically simulated ocean (no FFT).

## AI Coding & Architecture Assistants

### Google Gemini (2.5 Pro)

- **Authors/Gurus:** Google DeepMind
- **Source:** [Gemini 2.5 Pro | Gemini API (Google AI for Developers)](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini-2.5-pro)
- **Usage:** The flagship reasoning/thinking model used as a reference for solving complex engineering problems in `small-world` — analyzing large codebases, long-context reasoning over the engine architecture, and drafting architectural decisions. Serves as a counterpart to human review for high-level design and code-quality judgement.

### Claude Sonnet (Anthropic Claude Sonnet 5)

- **Authors/Gurus:** Anthropic
- **Source:** [Claude Models (Anthropic)](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview)
- **Usage:** The reference agentic coding assistant used as a second pair of eyes on cross-cutting architectural decisions and large multi-file refactors in `small-world`. Consulted for architecture reviews (e.g., renderer abstraction seams between WebGL2 and WebGPU, behavior-driven component design) and for writing/refactoring TypeScript code along the project's coding standards.

### DeepSeek V4 Flash

- **Authors/Gurus:** DeepSeek AI
- **Source:** [DeepSeek-V4-Flash (Hugging Face)](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash)
- **Usage:** A fast Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model (284B total / 13B activated parameters) used as a lightweight, high-throughput reference assistant for iterative coding and localized architecture checks during active development, trading deep reasoning for speed on routine code generation and short refactors within the engine.
